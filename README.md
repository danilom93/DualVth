# DualVth
TCL Algorithm for Slack-driven Dual-Vth postsynthesis optimization

Development of a TCL command integrated into Prime Time that performs a post synthesis Dual-Vth cell assignment for leakage power optimization.
The algorithm has been optimized to be efficient in term of power reduction, moreover the execution time has been taken into account such that a trade off between optimization and execution time has been reached.
